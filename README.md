# Shark attack Project - Data cleaning pandas

The objective of the study is to demonstrate through aquatic activities that shark attacks, despite Spilberg, are not so common and that they mostly occur to surfers, who are mistaken for seals, a favorite food of these animals. Being able to demonstrate this, we can offer the governments of the countries with the highest attack rate, how to dedicate more effective resources and personnel to the beaches most affected by the study.

## CONCLUSIONS

From what we can see in the graphs, there are few lethal attacks carried out by white sharks. Mostly focused on surfers, due to the characteristics of similarity and constant movement that confuse and deceive the shark. Therefore, by focusing resources on beaches with good surfing conditions, we could detect and scare away these magnificent animals, without having to fear serious consequences and creating safer environments that will be very well seen and valued by tourists and local citizens.
